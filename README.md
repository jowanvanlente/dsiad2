Step-by-step Guide to Install and Run Jupyter Notebooks using Anaconda

Step 1: Install Anaconda

Go to the Anaconda Installations page (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
Under "Anaconda Installers", select the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Click "Download" on the version that matches your system's architecture (probably 64-Bit Graphical Installer).
After the download finishes, proceed with the installation. Accept the default options unless you have specific reasons to change them.

Step 2: Launch Anaconda and Install Jupyter Notebook

Launch Anaconda Navigator, which was installed in the previous step. Depending on your operating system, it can be found in your start menu or applications folder.
Once launched, you'll see several applications available. Look for Jupyter Notebook and click "Launch". Jupyter should open in a new browser window.

Step 3: Download and Open the Notebook from Github

Download the zip file of this repository and unzip it to an accessible location.
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to your notebook file (.ipynb extension), which you have just downloaded and unzipped.
Click on the file name to open it.

Step 4: Run the Notebook

Once your Jupyter Notebook is open, you can run your code.
